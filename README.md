	An Astro integration for generating screenshots of your pages automatically at build time
</p>
<br/>
</div>

## 👋 About

Generate screenshots of your [Astro] pages automatically at build time with **Astro Snapshot**. Perfect for creating
social images, content previews, dynamic icons, and more!

This integration was inspired by [astro-selfie] and a similar plugin I wrote for [Gatsby] called
[Gatsby Plugin: Component to Image]. Compared to astro-selfie, this integration exposes a lot more configuration options
which allow you to completely customize how images are generated.

### Features

- **🧩 Framework agnostic**: Generate images from any valid Astro page
  - Unlike other integrations for generating social images, not limited to preset layouts
  - Unlike [Satori], not limited to certain types of JSX elements or CSS properties
  - Use whatever front-end framework you want
- **📸 Customizable outputs**: Full control over the generated images
  - Generate multiple images per page with different configurations
  - Save images to `public`, `dist`, `src`, or any other directory
  - Save PNG, JPEG, or WebP images, with the format automatically detected from the output filename
  - Save images at any resolution
  - Choose whether to overwrite existing images or skip them
- ⚙️ **Flexible configuration**: Advanced options for power users
  - Define global defaults to keep configs minimal and override them on a per-image basis
  - Pass through options directly to [Puppeteer] for precise control of the browser, viewport, and screenshot generation
    process
- 🔧 **TypeScript support**: Full type safety for all options and functions
  - Import types from the package to make sure your config is correct
  - Install the package from JSR for use with TypeScript-native runtimes like Deno

### Use Cases

- **🏞️ Social images**: Use your existing front-end components to generate [Open Graph] images and/or Twitter cards for
  your blog posts or other content
- **📰 Content previews**: Generate screenshots of your website for use in documentation, marketing materials,
  showcases, etc.
- **🖼️ Favicons**: Dynamically generate favicons for your website
